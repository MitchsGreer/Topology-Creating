# Topology-Creating
The goal of this project was to create topographical maps of cooperating gene structures during a specific treatment. This was to be done by taking a GEM and using the UMAP software to generate a topology for the matrix, then comparing these topologies for different GEMS to get a sense of what genes were working together in what situations.
